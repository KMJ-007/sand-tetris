# Sand Tetris

A simple Sand Tetris game made in Rust.

i got this [video](https://youtu.be/qHVeIvpbma0?si=ZzDwlIT8eN1GtWcI) in my youtube shorts really long time back and i really liked it, i was already aware about the work of [Max](https://github.com/MaxBittker), i wanted to make something like this, which feels satisfying and i enjoy it playing

# Motivation:
After working on [RustyScheme](https://github.com/KMJ-007/RustyScheme), i wanted to get rusty again and i was getting ghosted by girl i wanted to date, so i decided to make a game to distract me!
